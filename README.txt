This program is called Benchaholics, a fitness inspired webapp. This program requires several modules including flask,lxml,request, and scraper. Once you have installed all these modules, activate the virtual environment and run the main.py file. This will give you a link in your repl that you can go to and view the web app. In the sampleCSVuploadFiles you will find a template that you can use and a sample data sheet that can be used in the programs upload function.
